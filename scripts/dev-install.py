"""Install dossier's dev/test environment against the LOCKED suite substrate.

The paved path for both local dev and CI (Plan 019 B2). By default it installs
the regista spine at the exact released version pinned in ``SUITE.lock`` — the
artifact the suite ships — instead of a sibling's ``main`` / an editable checkout.
Developing against the lock is what catches integration skew (e.g. the 2026-07-21
interop break: a suite developed against a newer sibling than the lock pinned)
*before* interop time, not after.

Same install shape in dev and CI, so "works on my machine" means "works in CI".

Escape hatch — set ``DEV_AGAINST`` for deliberate cross-member work:

    DEV_AGAINST unset / lock   the locked release from PyPI            (default)
    DEV_AGAINST=sibling        editable ../regista working tree        (local co-dev)
    DEV_AGAINST=main | <ref>   regista from git at that branch/tag/SHA

Resolution lives in ``scripts/suite_lock.py`` (the single source of truth reader).

Usage:
    python scripts/dev-install.py            # install against the lock
    python scripts/dev-install.py --print    # show what it WOULD do, install nothing
    DEV_AGAINST=main python scripts/dev-install.py
