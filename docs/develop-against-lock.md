# Develop against the locked substrate (Plan 019 B2)

**`SUITE.lock` is the single source of truth for what to develop against.**

dossier is one member of a polyrepo suite held compatible by version contracts.
Its one real substrate sibling is **regista** (the spine). Feature work on
dossier should happen against the regista the suite *ships* — the released
version pinned in `SUITE.lock` — not against regista's `main` or an editable
checkout that has drifted ahead. Developing against `main` is how integration
skew hides until interop time: on 2026-07-21 an agent-suite smoke suite
developed against a newer sibling than the lock pinned, and the break only
surfaced at interop. B2 removes that failure mode by making "install the locked
substrate" the default for both local dev and CI.

## The default

```bash
make dev            # or: python scripts/dev-install.py
```

installs `regista-hraedon==<SUITE.lock [spine].version>` from PyPI (today
`0.5.3`), then `ruff` and `-e ".[dev]"` (pytest, httpx, mypy, ldap3, and the
pinned `agent-suite-conformance` kit). CI runs the **same**
`scripts/dev-install.py` in both the Linux (`check`) and `windows-test` lanes,
so "works on my machine" means "works in CI".

`SUITE.lock`'s `[spine]` section is the vendored, in-repo copy of the umbrella
`agent-suite/SUITE.lock` pin — it **must agree** with that umbrella's
`[components.regista]` `version` + `revision` (the umbrella is the generated
authority). Vendoring it here means CI resolves the spine without cloning
agent-suite.

## The container image

The `image` CI job reads `[spine].version` from `SUITE.lock` and passes it to the
Dockerfile as `--build-arg REGISTA_VERSION`; the Dockerfile installs
`regista-hraedon==<that version>` from PyPI (not a `git+SHA` build — the
distribution is published, and >= 0.5.2 fixes the post-rename version lookup).
`[component].version` and `[container]` drive the image tags
(`<registry>/<image>:<component.version>-<spine.version>`). So the lock is the
one place the spine version is set for both the test lanes and the image.

## The escape hatch — `DEV_AGAINST`

Cross-member work is not forbidden; it is channeled to one obvious switch so the
coupling is always visible:

| `DEV_AGAINST` | installs regista from | when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *unset* / `lock` | `regista-hraedon==<locked version>` (PyPI) | **default** — feature work on dossier alone |
| `sibling` | `-e ../regista` (editable working tree) | local co-development of regista + dossier together |
| `main` | `git+…/regista.git@main` | deliberately testing against regista's tip |
| `<ref>` | `git+…/regista.git@<ref>` | a specific regista branch / tag / SHA |

```bash
DEV_AGAINST=main    python scripts/dev-install.py    # test against regista tip
DEV_AGAINST=sibling python scripts/dev-install.py    # local co-dev (canonical clone)
python scripts/suite_lock.py describe                 # what am I developing against?
python scripts/suite_lock.py requirement --dev-against main
```

> `DEV_AGAINST=sibling` resolves `../regista`, which only exists in the
> constellation clone layout (`/projects/{regista,dossier}`), not inside a
> `git worktree`. Use it from the canonical clone.

## Enforcement

`tests/test_develop_against_lock.py` is the mechanical control: it fails if CI
hardcodes a regista version (the `0.5.1`-vs-`0.5.3` drift class this leg fixed)
or installs the spine from `git+…@ref` without going through the `DEV_AGAINST`
hatch, and it pins the resolver's default to `SUITE.lock`'s `[spine].version`.
Convention plus CI, not a doc sentence.
