"""Secret-backend resolution for dossier (Plan 013 WI-4.1).

Wraps regista's secret-backend resolver (regista ``_secrets.py``) so
dossier's suite-shared secrets — the regista DSN and the signing key-set —
may live in Vault / Azure Key Vault / env / file rather than a plaintext
config value. dossier is a *consumer*: regista defines the ref syntax and the
providers; this module routes dossier's configured values through it. This is
the same pattern agent-notes adopted (agent-notes Plan 017 WI-4.1); dossier
mirrors it so the two faces share one custody contract.

Two resolution kinds:

1. ``resolve_dsn(value)`` — for a *string* secret (a full DSN). A literal DSN
   (``postgresql://user:pw@host/db``) has no registered provider prefix, so it
   is returned unchanged — zero regression for today's plaintext-DSN installs,
   and regista is not even imported for the common case. A backend ref
   (``env:VAR``, ``vault:mount/path/key``, ``azure:name``, ``file:/path``)
   resolves to the DSN string at use time via ``regista.secrets.resolve_str``.

2. ``materialize_key_manifest(value)`` — for the signing *key-set*. regista's
   ``KeySet`` reads a JSON manifest from a path and already resolves per-key
   ``secret_ref`` from the backend (regista ``_keys.py``), so the manifest
   itself need not contain secrets. A bare filesystem path (today's default)
   is returned unchanged so regista reads + mtime-polls it directly — no temp
   file, no regression. A remote backend ref (``env:``/``vault:``/``azure:``)
   resolves to bytes and is written to a private (0600) temp file owned by
   this process; regista reads that path. The temp file is scrubbed at
   interpreter exit (``atexit``) and on gateway close, so no persisted material
   survives a clean shutdown — strictly better than a permanent plaintext key
   in ``~/.config/``. mtime-poll hot-reload is a no-op on this path (the temp
   file is static); rotating a backend-sourced manifest means restarting
   dossier, documented in the plan log.

Security note: resolution-failure messages surface only the exception *type*
(``RuntimeError("...: VaultError")``), never ``str(exc)`` — a backend error
may echo the ref or partial material, and doctor/JSON output may land in
aggregators. The ref itself (the configured value) is not secret, but a Vault
path could be sensitive in some deployments, so we keep messages type-only and
suppress the ``__cause__`` chain (``from None``). That is a deliberate
security-over-debuggability trade: a logged traceback will not show the
original regista exception (which can echo refs/paths), at the cost of needing
to reproduce locally with the raw resolver to see full backend diagnostics.
