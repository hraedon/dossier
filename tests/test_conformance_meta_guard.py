"""WI-026 meta-guard: prove dossier's conformance gate *runs*, not *skips*.

The silent-skip bug (2026-07-24) bit three components: their
``test_cli_conformance.py`` did ``pytest.importorskip("agent_suite.conformance")``
against a module that was never installed, so every case skipped, CI stayed
green, and zero contract was enforced. A skipped gate is indistinguishable from
a passing one in a green build — the canonical "fails open" hazard.

``assert_cases_declared`` (dogfooded in ``test_cli_conformance.py``, shipped by
kit 1.1.0) catches the "module loaded but a dimension is empty" half of the
class. This file catches the other half — "the whole module skipped" — by
running the conformance module as a subprocess and asserting at least one case
*passed* (not all-skipped). It is the only layer that catches ``importorskip``
firing against a missing/wrong kit module, because the importorskip'd module
never reaches ``assert_cases_declared``.

The guard is factored into a pure function (``require_gate_ran``) with two
independent signals — clean exit AND >=1 passed — so deny-cases can prove it
rejects an all-skip summary and a nonzero exit. That makes it provably not a
tautology over string matching (process-calibration §5): an end-to-end falsifier
builds a tiny module that importorskip's a bogus name and confirms the guard
flags it.

``ConformanceGateError`` comes from the kit (1.1.0). The kit import is guarded by
``importorskip`` so a dev who skipped the ``[dev]`` extra gets a clean skip here
too; in CI the kit is a mandatory pinned dep.
